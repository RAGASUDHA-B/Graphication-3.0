# Sales Data Visualization and Analysis 📊

This repository contains Python scripts and a presentation file that showcase a comprehensive analysis of sales data using visualization techniques. The project explores key insights such as customer behavior, discount impact, regional trends, and more
done by RAGASUDHA and PAVITHA 

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `analysis_code.py`: Python script for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `presentation.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.

## 🚀 Features

- **Discount Analysis**: Understand how discounts influence sales and revenue, and identify optimal discount ranges.
- **Monthly Trends**: Visualize sales performance across different months for various countries and products.
- **Customer Insights**:
  - Repeat customer analysis to track loyalty patterns.
  - Customer segmentation by channels (e.g., Gift Stores, General Stores).
- **Regional Trends**: Analyze sales trends by region and product lines.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

The project leverages the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
  - Key libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`.
- **PowerPoint**: To present the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## 📊 Visualizations

Key visualizations included:
1. Heatmaps for country-month sales trends.
2. Grouped bar charts for analyzing customer categories and sales by channels.
3. Stacked bar charts for product line contributions by country.
4. Pie charts for distribution of customer types.

## 💡 Insights

- **Discount Impact**: Discounts between 10-20% maximize revenue without significantly eating into profitability.
- **Customer Loyalty**: A significant percentage of customers are one-time buyers, presenting an opportunity for retention strategies.
- **Seasonality**: December consistently shows peak sales, indicating strong holiday demand across regions.
- **Top Channels**: Gift stores contribute the largest share of sales, followed by corporate buyers.

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Open `analysis_code.py` to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
     ```

2. **View the Presentation**:
   - Open `presentation.pptx` to explore the key insights derived from the analysis.

3. **Input Dataset**:
   - Ensure the dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`) is present in the same directory as the script.
